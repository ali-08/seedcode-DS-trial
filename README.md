# seedcode-DS-trial

The data contains 134 features for one target binary variable.  

The goal is to build a binary classifier that can classify that the given clinical trial will succeed or not. This has to be done with  positive prediction value (PPV) of 90% while maintaining a healthy detection rate (DR).
